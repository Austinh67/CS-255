*Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?*
DriverPass is a small company that wants to help potential drivers understand and pass the DMV license course. They goal is to make the 
informatione easier to understand and give a more comprehensive training course that normal. 

*What did you do particularly well?*
I think I did well when it comes to describing the needs of the company and going over the requirements needed to get the website running. 

*If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?*
I would develop my diagrams to be a little more involved and have more information. 

*How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?*
First I read in depth the transcript of the meeting with the client. Then I took basic knowledge of a website and implemented that into what I'd like to see DriverPass become. 

*How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?*
When I began learning programming I didn't see the truly beneficial aspect of diagrams, this class has helped immensely at describing and showing their versitality and importance
when it comes to system design.
